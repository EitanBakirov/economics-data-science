# Web Scraping and APIs Project

## Project Overview

This project provides a comprehensive guide to automating data extraction using web scraping and APIs. It is designed for data scientists, analysts, and anyone interested in collecting web-based data for analysis. The project demonstrates the use of key Python libraries and tools like `BeautifulSoup`, `Selenium`, and `requests` for web scraping, as well as API integration using `requests` and `pandas` to fetch, analyze, and manipulate data from websites and APIs.

The project includes a mini project that combines web scraping and API usage to retrieve the top 20 Spotify artists and analyze their data using the Spotify API.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **BeautifulSoup**: HTML parsing for static content scraping.
- **Selenium**: Scraping dynamic content from websites.
- **Requests**: Sending HTTP requests and interacting with APIs.
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and storage.
- **Spotify API**: Used for retrieving artist data.

## Web Scraping Overview

This section covers:
1. **Basic Web Scraping**: Using `BeautifulSoup` to scrape static content from websites. This includes parsing HTML, selecting elements using CSS selectors, and extracting relevant data like job listings and product details.
2. **Handling Dynamic Content**: Using `Selenium` to scrape dynamic content loaded by JavaScript, such as infinite scroll pages or dynamically loaded products on e-commerce sites.
3. **Challenges in Web Scraping**:
   - Handling anti-scraping mechanisms like Captchas and rate limits.
   - Using proxies and rotating User-Agent headers to avoid IP blocking.

## API Overview

This section covers:
1. **API Basics**: Explains how to interact with external APIs using `requests` to send GET and POST requests. 
2. **Handling JSON Data**: Extracting and parsing JSON responses from APIs.
3. **Authentication**: Demonstrates how to authenticate API requests using API keys or OAuth tokens.
4. **Spotify API Example**: Shows how to use the Spotify API to retrieve data about artists, including information about their top tracks and popularity.

## Mini Project

### Project Overview:
In this mini project, we combine web scraping and API integration. The goal is to:
1. Scrape the **top 20 Spotify artists** from a website.
2. Use the **Spotify API** to retrieve detailed information about each artist, including their top-performing songs and associated metadata.
3. Store the collected data in a `pandas` dataframe for further analysis.

## How to Run the Project

Just click on the "Open in Colab" at the top of the file.


## Best Practices and Ethical Considerations

1. **Respect Robots.txt**: Always check a website's `robots.txt` file before scraping to ensure you are allowed to scrape its content.
2. **Respect API Rate Limits**: When using APIs, make sure to respect the rate limits to avoid being blocked.
3. **Legal Considerations**: Ensure that you comply with any legal requirements or terms of service when scraping websites or using APIs. Avoid scraping sensitive or private data without permission.
4. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling in your code to manage situations like network timeouts, rate limits, or unexpected API responses.
